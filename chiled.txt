Childhood
Each country defined the age of childhood at a certain age. Some defined it by the age of 13, some by 18, and some by the twenty-first. However, the most common age among countries in which the age of childhood was determined is the age of 18.

The period of childhood is an early period of human life, where psychologists described it as a very sensitive period, and it is also at the same time flexible period of human life, where man acquires in this period the habits that remain inherent to him throughout his life.

The importance of childhood is summarized in the acquisition of different customs and values ​​during it; if acquired good habits, human values ​​and ethics, he will grow up with them, but if he acquired bad habits and bad morals, it would be a burden on society when he grows up.

This does not mean that man can not change when he grows up. Everything can be reformed if there is the will and determination to do so.

However, it must be said that the responsibility of this matter lies with the whole society and not only the state, despite they responsible for the largest role in this section because they has the power and the implementation of the law, as individuals must inform the concerned parties about the existence of certain irregularities to protect the future of children.
